                We’re not really into blowing our own trumpet too loud. It’s just the way we are. But then, we’ve done some pretty awesome
                stuff in the last few years. Here’s a peek.

                        15,500 words in 90 minutes! That’s 172 words a minute or better still, 2.87 words a second! What’s that you ask? That’s the
                        amount of content that was generated at India’s first ever Speed Blogging Contest! We created history,
                        on 27th September, 2013 <span class="bold">with India’s First Speed Blogging Contest.</span>                        A unique concept which revolved around creating lots of new content on a plethora of topics within
                        a limited time frame. The participants had to write original posts on the topics which appeared on
                        their screens every ten minutes. Call this more of a battle of wits and a test of your ability as
                        a blogger to think out of the box!

                        It means exactly what it sounds like – a tweeting marathon! Tweetathon was an online event where Tweeps centred their tweets
                        around a particular topic. On 25th September, 2014 we, along with a bunch of tweeps, managed to tweet
                        our way to glory with topics that covered everything under the sun. Oh, did we mention that the topics
                        changed every minute? Although it was a Tweetathon, it provided insight into how we create and consume
                        content. Definitely a great way to get rid of a writer’s block. #WeThink

                        Ideas are extremely elusive and the power of ideas is like no other. ‘Content Connect’ was a series of Writing Workshops,
                        which we established to help participants learn and share new ideas as well as elements that helped enhance
                        their writing skills. Spread over multiple workshop led sessions, this program covered various forms
                        of written content such as blogs, reviews, SEO content, website copy, script writing, press releases,
                        copy writing and much more. Content Connect was a platform created with an objective to equip you
                        with all the attributes of great content through a series of writing workshops.
