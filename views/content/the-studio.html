        Think about the last piece of communication you consumed. Chances are, it’s a video embedded in a blog from your favourite
        site. From crafting brand stories to grabbing attention or simply explaining a concept though a testimonial, a video
        starts with an idea, leads to a script and then leads to a memory that builds recall and builds preference.
